Presentation on Normalizer-Free (Res)Netss conducted at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology on 10 March. 2021.

We discuss findings presented in [High-Performance Large-Scale Image Recognition Without Normalization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06171.pdf) by Brock et al. and some earlier works. We introduce the concept of NF Net and we score its advantages and disadvantages.
